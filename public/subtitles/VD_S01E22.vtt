00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.064
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

2
00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:07.728
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

3
00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:09.771
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

4
00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.739
Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.037
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.

6
00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.545
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.

7
00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.842
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel
so she can give it to John.

8
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.544
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take the spell off.

9
00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.387
You took a risk with Damon.
How'd you know he would give it to me?

10
00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:31.961
Because he's in love with you.

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.699
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
It wasn't right.

12
00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:41.629
But when Elena finds out...

13
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.199
...she's never gonna forgive me.

14
00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.474
Ow. This dress hurts.

15
00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.635
Suck it in, baby.

16
00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:30.286
Timberwolves! Timberwolves! Go Big Red!

17
00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.981
No, no, no. This lineup is all wrong.

18
00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:35.854
The marching band is
in front of the historical society.

19
00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.495
Matt, time to get on your float.

20
00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:41.622
Boys, I asked you to put the chairs
on the Founder's float.

21
00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:44.898
Ladies, time to get on your float.

22
00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:47.829
Look at you, all retro.

23
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.270
- What are you doing here?
- Why wouldn't I be here?

24
00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:57.211
Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention,
Isobel's gone and it's Founder's Day.

25
00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.816
I'm here to eat cotton candy
and steal your girl.

26
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.820
- Don't start with me.
- Oh, you started it, Stefan...

27
00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.152
...with that whole "I'm insecure,
leave Elena alone" speech.

28
00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.260
I'm still enjoying that.

29
00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.362
- As long as you heard it.
- Wait, huh?

30
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.929
What?

31
00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:15.866
You have no sense of humor.

32
00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:19.526
Actually, I just have no sense
of Damon humor.

33
00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:22.498
Damon humor? Hey, look, I get it.

34
00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:26.235
I get it. I'm the better, hotter,
superior choice and you're scared...

35
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:29.574
...now that Katherine's out of the picture,
I'm gonna turn to Elena.

36
00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.717
But don't worry. Elena is not Katherine.

37
00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:35.246
You're right. She's not.

38
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.427
Anna.

39
00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:20.922
Look at you.

40
00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:25.396
Heh. I know, it's stupid, huh?
I'm part of the parade.

41
00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.765
But how are you? I've been so worried...

42
00:03:29.374 --> 00:03:31.103
...and I feel awful.

43
00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.766
Why?

44
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:35.571
You didn't kill my mother. Your uncle did.

45
00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:37.745
Are you sure it was him?

46
00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.474
Who else would've done it?

47
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.979
He doesn't understand, Anna.
It's who he is. He hates all vampires.

48
00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:48.550
He's just doing what he thinks is right.

49
00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:50.451
Are you defending him?

50
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.298
No. No way.

51
00:03:53.665 --> 00:03:54.962
It's just...

52
00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.658
I do understand where he's coming from.

53
00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:02.796
He's convinced all the tomb vampires
want revenge on this town and he's just...

54
00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.069
He's trying to protect it.

55
00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:07.402
They do want revenge.

56
00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:09.408
Or at least they did.

57
00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:12.408
But that's why we separated from them.

58
00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:16.350
My mom wasn't after revenge.
She just wanted her life back.

59
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.922
I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.

60
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.684
You're leaving?

61
00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:26.196
But I've been thinking, you could come.

62
00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:28.424
I could turn you.
You said you wanted me to.

63
00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:31.100
Here.

64
00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:33.564
It's my blood.

65
00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:36.834
If you die with it in your system,
you'll come back.

66
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.435
- Anna...
- I know you.

67
00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:42.136
What it's like for you.

68
00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:47.183
Being alone, always feeling empty inside,
no one to understand.

69
00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.613
But when you're a vampire,
you don't have to feel that way.

70
00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.723
You can shut it off.

71
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.324
I can show you how.

72
00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:01.064
I wanted to. I did.

73
00:05:06.938 --> 00:05:08.963
But I don't think I can.

74
00:05:09.474 --> 00:05:10.998
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:18.840
John?

76
00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:20.908
Is that even possible?

77
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.751
Well, there's no proof, but he dated Isobel
when she was a teenager.

78
00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:27.551
He brought her to your dad's office
for the delivery.

79
00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:31.856
My whole life
I've never liked this man. L...

80
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.722
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

81
00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:37.391
Wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it
on you in some inappropriate way.

82
00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.868
No, I'm happy that you told me. I just...

83
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.234
I really hope that it's not true.

84
00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:46.203
What am I supposed to do?

85
00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:51.281
Do I just confront him and say,
"Are you my biological father?"

86
00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:54.352
Well, I guess when you're ready.

87
00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:56.046
I'm never gonna be ready.

88
00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:01.190
Stefan, I have enough problems
with the family that I actually care about.

89
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.988
Jeremy hates me. And why wouldn't he?

90
00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:06.187
My journal gave him
every single reason to.

91
00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:07.992
He's just hurt. He's confused.

92
00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.066
He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki.

93
00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.396
For taking away his memory,
for lying to him.

94
00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:15.199
He's your brother. He'll forgive you.

95
00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:16.966
Just give him some time.

96
00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:19.404
- Say cheese.
- Ooh, wait.

97
00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:22.638
- Hide your cast. It's not era-appropriate.
- Seriously?

98
00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:24.811
- Yes.
- Okay. All right. Come here.

99
00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:28.610
I want one with Bonnie.

100
00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:29.913
- Okay.
- I can take it.

101
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:34.483
I'll be on the float.

102
00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:37.820
I said I was sorry.

103
00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:41.164
You made out with his mother
and then you beat him to a pulp.

104
00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:44.325
You're gonna have to do
a little bit better than sorry.

105
00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:47.729
Jeremy.

106
00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:51.576
I was wondering where you were.
You look great.

107
00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:54.735
- You guys did a really great job on the float.
- Go away, Elena.

108
00:06:54.913 --> 00:06:57.882
Jeremy, please.
I don't want it to be like this between us.

109
00:06:58.049 --> 00:07:00.279
Why don't you have Damon
erase my memory again?

110
00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:03.114
Then I could go back
to being your in-the-dark brother.

111
00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:05.848
- Jer, please.
- Just don't.

112
00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:12.019
You can't fix this that easily.
Something like this doesn't just get fixed.

113
00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:23.606
Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Falls
High School Marching Band.

114
00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:26.169
Yeah!

115
00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:37.014
And for a little local history...

116
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:41.353
...Mr. Saltzman's students have re-created
Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.

117
00:07:46.998 --> 00:07:49.330
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

118
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:55.406
...our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court
and their handsome escorts.

119
00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:06.414
This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls.

120
00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.084
Aren't they beautiful?

121
00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:30.732
What do you want?

122
00:08:31.743 --> 00:08:33.768
Just watching the parade.

123
00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:35.941
- Where you going?
- Away from you.

124
00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:38.105
- I wanna say something.
- Leave me alone.

125
00:08:38.283 --> 00:08:39.443
Thank you.

126
00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:43.187
The device that Emily spelled
could've killed me.

127
00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:45.789
I don't take what you did lightly...

128
00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:47.416
...so thank you.

129
00:08:49.694 --> 00:08:52.959
- I did it for Elena.
- I know that, but I'm still very grateful.

130
00:08:56.034 --> 00:08:57.626
And I owe you.

131
00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.473
Enjoy the parade.

132
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.476
Oh, there they are. Look.

133
00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:11.207
Let's cheer for
the Mystic Falls High School football team.

134
00:09:11.383 --> 00:09:15.444
All right. Let's show
them our support, everybody.

135
00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:24.489
This is the key.

136
00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:27.154
Once inserted,
the device will be activated.

137
00:09:27.332 --> 00:09:30.267
It will work only once
for an estimated time of five minutes.

138
00:09:30.602 --> 00:09:31.967
Yeah, so how does it work?

139
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.704
It's a high-pitched frequency
that humans can't hear.

140
00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:39.333
Any vampire within a five-block radius
will be incapacitated, exposing them.

141
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:42.674
At that time, the sheriff's deputies
will inject them with vervain...

142
00:09:42.847 --> 00:09:45.509
...and bring them here,
where we'll finish them off.

143
00:09:45.684 --> 00:09:47.743
- They're attacking tonight?
- I had a source.

144
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.845
One of the vampires from the tomb
confirmed the attack.

145
00:09:51.022 --> 00:09:52.956
Everybody listen up.

146
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.425
The plan stays the same.

147
00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:57.255
We wait till the fireworks start.

148
00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:59.954
Until then, we blend in.

149
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:02.793
Stay part of the celebration.
They'll never see us coming.

150
00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:06.597
They want revenge
for what our ancestors did in 1864.

151
00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:08.102
Which makes us their targets.

152
00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:10.207
This area here is the stage.

153
00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:12.639
This is where the founding families
are gonna be.

154
00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:15.737
Any questions?

155
00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:20.146
Taking an enormous risk.
Talking about our families, John.

156
00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:25.183
Anna.

157
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.519
What are you doing here?

158
00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:31.492
This is the only way.
Draw them out and kill them.

159
00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.358
All of them.

160
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.413
I like you better like this.

161
00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:56.918
Period look, it didn't suit you.

162
00:10:58.156 --> 00:10:59.214
Is that an insult?

163
00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:04.418
Actually, Elena,
it is a compliment of the highest order.

164
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:11.732
Look, I know Stefan is worried
about our friendship.

165
00:11:12.203 --> 00:11:14.330
Did he mention something to you too?

166
00:11:14.506 --> 00:11:16.701
- No. Did he mention something to you?
- No.

167
00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:18.566
Nothing worth repeating.

168
00:11:19.477 --> 00:11:23.004
You should stop with the flirty comments
and that eye thing that you do.

169
00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:25.479
What eye thing?

170
00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.716
Hm.

171
00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:32.513
Don't make me regret being your friend.

172
00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:35.757
Okay?

173
00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:49.063
I don't believe that we can't fix this.

174
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.902
I lied. I was wrong.

175
00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:53.476
But you're my brother, Jer.

176
00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:56.136
And I love you and I have to fix it.

177
00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:58.282
So just tell me, what can I do?

178
00:12:02.153 --> 00:12:03.950
You can go to hell, Elena.

179
00:12:22.774 --> 00:12:26.676
I have so many emotions,
but I don't have any way to express them.

180
00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:28.710
- Being a teenager is so hard.
- Dick.

181
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.075
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.

182
00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:34.047
And from now on,
don't talk to your sister that way either.

183
00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:36.380
You're gonna kill me
because I hurt Elena?

184
00:12:36.554 --> 00:12:37.987
Cut her some slack.

185
00:12:38.957 --> 00:12:41.551
- She erased my memories.
- No. I did.

186
00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:43.921
She was protecting you.

187
00:12:45.497 --> 00:12:47.488
That wasn't her call to make.

188
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:53.863
- Let go before I cause a scene.
- You'd be unconscious...

189
00:12:54.038 --> 00:12:56.302
...before you even got a word out.
- Let him go.

190
00:12:59.244 --> 00:13:00.506
You all right?

191
00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:02.077
Yeah.

192
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.678
What my brother is trying to say
is don't blame Elena for this.

193
00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:09.217
Damon turned Vicki.

194
00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:12.147
I killed her.

195
00:13:12.857 --> 00:13:17.055
She was a threat to you
and she was a threat to your sister.

196
00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:21.021
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.

197
00:13:24.435 --> 00:13:26.562
Shouldn't have made me forget.

198
00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:30.872
- Good cop, bad cop. I like it.
- What are you doing?

199
00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:33.670
- He was a punk.
- Elena's relationship with her brother...

200
00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:38.077
...is none of your business. Stay out of it.
- There's only one do-gooder role available.

201
00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:40.012
Oh, my bad. I'm sorry.

202
00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:43.018
We both know you're not doing this
for the right reasons.

203
00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:46.082
See? There you go
with that little jealousy act again.

204
00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:48.418
It just...
What are the right reasons, Stefan?

205
00:13:48.593 --> 00:13:50.424
- Enlighten me, please.
- See, Damon...

206
00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:54.656
...it's only real when it comes
from your desire to do the right thing.

207
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:55.857
For nothing in return.

208
00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:57.058
- Right.
- And I know...

209
00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:59.601
...that is an entirely foreign concept
to you.

210
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:02.899
I completely understand
how you wouldn't get it.

211
00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:07.838
You wanna use our town as bait?

212
00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:10.545
It's too dangerous. It's insane.

213
00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:13.878
We've gone over the plans
with your deputies. They're all on board.

214
00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:17.619
- You've gone behind me?
- We knew this is how you'd react.

215
00:14:17.789 --> 00:14:20.417
- Our children are here.
- Liz, we need to do this.

216
00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:23.659
We have no choice.
This is the reason for the secret council.

217
00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:27.924
Our founding fathers created
the secret council for just this purpose.

218
00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.663
I'm the sheriff and it's my call...

219
00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:37.865
...and I say no.

220
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.979
Richard, let me speak
to the sheriff alone.

221
00:14:47.652 --> 00:14:49.882
John, you're not thinking clearly.

222
00:14:50.054 --> 00:14:52.545
I'm not gonna change my mind
about this.

223
00:15:19.584 --> 00:15:20.608
You're still around?

224
00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:26.854
There's something you need to know.

225
00:15:27.025 --> 00:15:30.051
The vampires from the tomb
are planning an attack tonight.

226
00:15:30.695 --> 00:15:32.322
- How do you know?
- I went to them.

227
00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:34.158
They think I'm with them. I'm not.

228
00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:37.697
They want the founding families dead.

229
00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:41.138
When is this supposed to happen?

230
00:15:41.806 --> 00:15:43.501
When the fireworks start.

231
00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:49.002
John Gilbert wants to use that invention
on them.

232
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.774
- We can't be here.
- Doesn't work. It's been deactivated.

233
00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:55.143
- Then a lot of people are gonna die.
- Where are they right now?

234
00:15:56.154 --> 00:15:57.951
They're already here, Damon.

235
00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:03.221
Remember, we don't know which of them
ingests vervain.

236
00:16:03.394 --> 00:16:07.228
It's not about the feed.
It's about the kill.

237
00:16:07.432 --> 00:16:09.297
You know what to do.

238
00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:18.933
- Ric.
- Yeah.

239
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.372
Come here.

240
00:16:20.545 --> 00:16:22.843
You keep those nifty vamp weapons
in the car?

241
00:16:23.014 --> 00:16:24.140
Yeah. Why do you ask?

242
00:16:24.315 --> 00:16:26.340
This square is crawling
with tomb vampires.

243
00:16:26.517 --> 00:16:28.144
We might need a stake or two.

244
00:16:28.319 --> 00:16:29.616
- Yeah. Got it.
- Go.

245
00:16:29.787 --> 00:16:32.153
I know. Can you imagine?

246
00:16:34.492 --> 00:16:35.857
Hey.

247
00:16:36.027 --> 00:16:37.790
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

248
00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:40.362
Fifteen words or less,
tomb vamps are here.

249
00:16:40.932 --> 00:16:42.524
Founding families are the target.

250
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.362
- Get her out of here. Now.
- Wait. Where are you going?

251
00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:48.096
- That's more than 15 words, Stefan.
- Wait.

252
00:16:48.272 --> 00:16:49.364
Jeremy's out here.

253
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.343
Let's go find him. Come on.

254
00:16:58.449 --> 00:17:00.178
There was this time, freshman year...

255
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:04.515
...when Bonnie and I were in a fight and
we swore that we would never talk again.

256
00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:05.951
Caroline, give it a rest.

257
00:17:09.894 --> 00:17:11.589
Thanks.

258
00:17:17.802 --> 00:17:19.929
What are you doing here?
I told you to go home.

259
00:17:20.104 --> 00:17:23.005
- I decided not to.
- Lf I tell you to do something, you do it.

260
00:17:23.174 --> 00:17:25.699
- Get off me.
- Mayor. Is everything okay?

261
00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:33.240
Please, Tyler.
I need you to go home. Now.

262
00:17:34.118 --> 00:17:36.746
- Take your friends with you.
- Wait. Why? What's going on?

263
00:17:39.023 --> 00:17:40.456
I can't explain.

264
00:17:40.758 --> 00:17:43.124
All of you need to get home now.

265
00:17:43.561 --> 00:17:44.994
Please.

266
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:46.954
Yeah, okay.

267
00:17:48.933 --> 00:17:50.298
Here.

268
00:17:50.802 --> 00:17:52.929
Take my car. It's out back.

269
00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:56.864
Caroline, Matt, go with him.

270
00:17:57.308 --> 00:17:58.570
Come on.

271
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.840
Anna, my uncle could see you.

272
00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:09.281
I don't care about that.

273
00:18:09.454 --> 00:18:10.648
I needed to find you.

274
00:18:11.689 --> 00:18:13.179
Come here.

275
00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:17.789
For 150 years...

276
00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:22.592
...Mystic Falls has been the kind of town
that everybody wants to call home.

277
00:18:22.767 --> 00:18:26.464
Safe, prosperous, welcoming.

278
00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:30.805
And we have the founders
to thank for that.

279
00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:34.634
That's why I'd like to dedicate
this evening's fireworks display...

280
00:18:34.812 --> 00:18:36.939
...to their legacy.

281
00:18:46.991 --> 00:18:48.686
Get into position.

282
00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:56.556
Enjoy the show.

283
00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:07.143
Stay close, dear.

284
00:19:25.897 --> 00:19:28.422
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

285
00:19:39.177 --> 00:19:40.769
Do you have any idea what you've done?

286
00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:43.004
Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

287
00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:54.255
Stefan? What's going on?
What's happening?

288
00:19:54.659 --> 00:19:56.183
- My head.
- What?

289
00:19:57.461 --> 00:19:59.156
My head.

290
00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:05.629
Anna? Anna, what's wrong? Anna?

291
00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:08.695
- Please make it stop.
- What's happening?

292
00:20:20.618 --> 00:20:21.642
What the hell is that?

293
00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:23.145
What's the matter?

294
00:20:23.321 --> 00:20:25.221
- That noise.
- Wait. What noise?

295
00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:29.426
- Oh!
- Whoa.

296
00:20:29.594 --> 00:20:32.825
- Tyler? Tyler!
- Dude, hey!

297
00:20:34.966 --> 00:20:36.831
- Caroline, the wheel!
- Tyler!

298
00:20:50.514 --> 00:20:51.947
Hey. I got this one.

299
00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:54.846
There's another one over there.
Take this. Go. Go. Go.

300
00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:56.610
Get up.

301
00:20:58.022 --> 00:21:01.014
- He just dropped.
- Yeah, he's not the only one.

302
00:21:01.192 --> 00:21:03.922
Cops are grabbing everyone who's down.
Injecting vervain.

303
00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:05.562
- What?
- Yeah.

304
00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:10.024
They're rounding up the vampires.

305
00:21:10.201 --> 00:21:12.032
Please help him. He just went down.

306
00:21:12.637 --> 00:21:14.229
Is that the mayor?

307
00:21:15.473 --> 00:21:17.907
- Richard.
- Is he all right?

308
00:21:19.577 --> 00:21:21.169
My head. Jeremy.

309
00:21:21.912 --> 00:21:22.936
Hey, I got one.

310
00:21:24.081 --> 00:21:25.309
Hey, what are you doing?

311
00:21:26.517 --> 00:21:29.008
- What are you doing? Leave her alone.
- All right.

312
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.688
- What are you doing? Leave her alone!
- Hey.

313
00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:34.216
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Leave her alone! Anna!

314
00:22:01.218 --> 00:22:02.276
The device is done.

315
00:22:02.453 --> 00:22:04.944
The only thing
keeping them down is the vervain.

316
00:22:05.122 --> 00:22:07.317
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.

317
00:22:13.664 --> 00:22:14.824
Anna.

318
00:22:19.603 --> 00:22:21.366
You head up. I'll take it from here.

319
00:22:33.818 --> 00:22:35.217
Please.

320
00:22:37.254 --> 00:22:38.278
No.

321
00:23:25.603 --> 00:23:28.265
- You okay?
- It was like needles were piercing my skull.

322
00:23:28.439 --> 00:23:29.736
And then it just stopped.

323
00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:32.269
I saw at least five vampires go down.

324
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.406
They're taking them
to your family's old building.

325
00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.211
It's the Gilbert device.

326
00:23:38.382 --> 00:23:39.406
It has to be.

327
00:23:39.583 --> 00:23:41.278
But how did he get it to work?

328
00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:42.680
Bonnie unspelled it.

329
00:23:43.254 --> 00:23:44.278
Or maybe she didn't.

330
00:23:44.822 --> 00:23:46.187
She did. We saw her do it.

331
00:23:47.057 --> 00:23:48.524
No. He's right. Think about it.

332
00:23:49.293 --> 00:23:51.818
We asked Bonnie
to deactivate a device...

333
00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:54.430
...that could protect people
against vampires.

334
00:23:54.598 --> 00:23:55.758
So we could protect you.

335
00:23:55.933 --> 00:23:57.867
And Damon. Vampires.

336
00:24:00.604 --> 00:24:02.162
- Where's Damon?
- I don't know.

337
00:24:02.339 --> 00:24:04.204
I haven't seen him since this started.

338
00:24:05.976 --> 00:24:08.877
- Can you get my brother? Take him home?
- Of course.

339
00:24:09.613 --> 00:24:11.376
Let's go.

340
00:24:14.118 --> 00:24:16.951
- Liz. You okay? What is going on?
- There's a key in my belt.

341
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:19.248
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.

342
00:24:19.423 --> 00:24:22.756
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Something's happened to Richard.

343
00:24:22.927 --> 00:24:24.417
- They took him.
- Who took him?

344
00:24:24.595 --> 00:24:25.721
Your deputies.

345
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.827
I don't understand. He's not a vampire.

346
00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:31.958
Let's go.

347
00:24:38.642 --> 00:24:40.166
Mayor.

348
00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:43.143
- Is that you?
- What are you doing here?

349
00:24:43.948 --> 00:24:45.142
I'm a vampire.

350
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:48.341
What is your excuse?

351
00:24:50.154 --> 00:24:51.849
No, really.

352
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.389
The vervain didn't affect you.

353
00:24:54.892 --> 00:24:56.416
You're not a vampire.

354
00:24:57.661 --> 00:24:59.424
What the hell are you?

355
00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:02.159
Mayor Lockwood.

356
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.335
You okay?
Your side took the biggest hit.

357
00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:10.497
- I'm fine.
- No, they need to check you out.

358
00:25:10.674 --> 00:25:13.666
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
They're helping Tyler.

359
00:25:13.844 --> 00:25:15.937
Pulse is steadying.

360
00:25:16.113 --> 00:25:17.273
All right.

361
00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:24.511
What the hell?

362
00:25:24.688 --> 00:25:26.349
What? What's wrong?

363
00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:27.718
The eyes.

364
00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:38.934
- What happened?
- Dude, don't scare me like that.

365
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.233
Hey. She needs some help over here.

366
00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:42.736
Caroline.

367
00:25:43.374 --> 00:25:45.535
- Over here. Caroline.
- There. Get that one.

368
00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:48.801
Caroline, hey. Wake up.
We're gonna get you home. Wake up, Car.

369
00:25:50.347 --> 00:25:51.871
Wait, wait, wait.

370
00:25:52.683 --> 00:25:54.310
I can hear them.

371
00:25:54.785 --> 00:25:56.377
- The building is on fire.
- What?

372
00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:57.816
Building's on fire.

373
00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:08.827
Where is Damon?

374
00:26:09.767 --> 00:26:12.930
With the rest of them,
where he should be.

375
00:26:13.103 --> 00:26:14.161
It's over for Damon.

376
00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:17.598
You're crazy.

377
00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:21.506
Why? Because I'm doing
what should've been done 145 years ago?

378
00:26:21.879 --> 00:26:23.744
This is the right thing, Elena.

379
00:26:26.483 --> 00:26:29.509
Go ahead. You won't make it out.

380
00:26:29.787 --> 00:26:32.722
You'll save me the trouble
of killing you myself.

381
00:26:33.958 --> 00:26:36.688
You know the building well.
Is there another entrance in?

382
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.158
Utility door. There's one around the side.

383
00:26:41.699 --> 00:26:44.827
One more step and I'll alert those deputies
they missed a vampire.

384
00:26:45.336 --> 00:26:47.031
I'm asking you not to.

385
00:26:47.204 --> 00:26:49.764
That doesn't mean anything to me.

386
00:26:50.874 --> 00:26:53.365
As my father, it should.

387
00:27:01.085 --> 00:27:02.279
You know.

388
00:27:03.287 --> 00:27:05.152
I wasn't sure.

389
00:27:05.322 --> 00:27:06.380
But now I am.

390
00:27:13.897 --> 00:27:16.161
Hey! You can't go in there.

391
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:18.198
The fire will take you out.

392
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:21.134
He's my brother, Bonnie.

393
00:27:29.513 --> 00:27:30.571
Stefan!

394
00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:35.173
- Elena, you can't go in there.
- Bonnie, what are you doing?

395
00:27:35.352 --> 00:27:36.376
I'm sorry I lied to you.

396
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.886
I've gotta get in there.

397
00:28:12.056 --> 00:28:15.719
Damon. Come on. Hurry up.

398
00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:35.645
Bonnie.

399
00:28:36.447 --> 00:28:39.245
Bonnie, what is it?
Are they gonna be okay?

400
00:28:42.219 --> 00:28:43.379
Oh, God.

401
00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:50.025
Oh, my God.

402
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.595
Two 10-45s will be treated at county...

403
00:29:07.077 --> 00:29:08.135
The fire is out.

404
00:29:08.312 --> 00:29:11.839
The story is that the building's old wiring
is what caused it.

405
00:29:13.784 --> 00:29:15.479
Did you see where Damon went?

406
00:29:15.786 --> 00:29:17.845
No. He just kind of disappeared.

407
00:29:19.123 --> 00:29:20.681
Figures.

408
00:29:24.795 --> 00:29:27.491
I'm so glad you're okay.

409
00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:32.561
I try so hard...

410
00:29:33.203 --> 00:29:34.500
...to hate him.

411
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.271
I guess it's just pointless.

412
00:29:39.777 --> 00:29:40.801
You care about him.

413
00:29:43.147 --> 00:29:44.910
So do I.

414
00:29:48.218 --> 00:29:50.652
But I love you, Stefan.

415
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:53.712
And I know
that you're worried about that.

416
00:29:55.893 --> 00:29:57.622
Well, I just...

417
00:29:57.828 --> 00:29:59.728
You know, I know my brother.

418
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.061
But I love you, Stefan.

419
00:30:02.232 --> 00:30:04.462
I know the trouble he can cause...

420
00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:08.366
I love you, Stefan. You.

421
00:30:20.417 --> 00:30:22.817
You have nothing to worry about.

422
00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:25.989
- Okay?
- Yeah.

423
00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:30.387
So l... Jenna called.

424
00:30:30.561 --> 00:30:33.359
Jeremy is home.
I'm just gonna run over to the school...

425
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.691
...to pick up my dress, my clothes,
my stuff...

426
00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:37.390
...and then I'll check on him.

427
00:31:00.824 --> 00:31:02.553
What are you doing here?

428
00:31:03.594 --> 00:31:04.720
Anna's dead.

429
00:31:07.297 --> 00:31:10.027
I figured that once they took her away.

430
00:31:11.702 --> 00:31:13.135
I know you cared about her.

431
00:31:14.938 --> 00:31:16.667
Yeah, I did.

432
00:31:18.008 --> 00:31:19.532
I saw her killed.

433
00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:25.143
I was watching
and all I could think about was...

434
00:31:26.817 --> 00:31:28.944
I wanted to help her.

435
00:31:30.354 --> 00:31:31.582
But I couldn't.

436
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.657
Why are you telling me all this?

437
00:31:36.994 --> 00:31:38.985
I took away your suffering once before.

438
00:31:39.162 --> 00:31:41.255
I can do it again.

439
00:31:42.065 --> 00:31:43.828
But it's your choice.

440
00:31:44.668 --> 00:31:46.101
Look...

441
00:31:47.237 --> 00:31:49.933
...I know you think you took it away...

442
00:31:50.707 --> 00:31:52.607
...but it's still there.

443
00:31:53.543 --> 00:31:58.003
Even if I can't remember why,
I still feel empty.

444
00:31:58.548 --> 00:32:00.106
Alone.

445
00:32:01.852 --> 00:32:04.514
And making me forget won't fix it.

446
00:32:06.857 --> 00:32:09.485
It won't fix what's really wrong.

447
00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.959
What I did to Vicki...

448
00:32:20.103 --> 00:32:21.695
...was wrong.

449
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.866
Sorry for my part.

450
00:32:31.281 --> 00:32:33.943
Anna said that vampires
don't have to feel pain.

451
00:32:34.117 --> 00:32:37.450
That they could turn it off
if they shut out their humanity.

452
00:32:40.057 --> 00:32:41.718
That's very true.

453
00:32:42.192 --> 00:32:43.659
Is it easier that way?

454
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:46.789
Is what easier?

455
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:49.626
Life.

456
00:32:50.834 --> 00:32:52.324
Life sucks either way, Jeremy.

457
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:58.036
If you're a vampire, you don't have
to feel bad if you don't want to.

458
00:32:58.542 --> 00:33:00.066
Is that what you did?

459
00:33:01.411 --> 00:33:03.242
I did it for...

460
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.914
I did it for a very long time.

461
00:33:08.652 --> 00:33:10.916
And life was a lot easier.

462
00:33:22.699 --> 00:33:23.723
Hey, man.

463
00:33:26.203 --> 00:33:29.661
I'm so sorry. Look, I don't even know
what happened.

464
00:33:31.908 --> 00:33:33.603
It's okay, man.

465
00:33:33.777 --> 00:33:35.244
She'll be all right.

466
00:33:46.523 --> 00:33:48.013
What's happening? She all right?

467
00:33:49.192 --> 00:33:52.025
There was internal bleeding.
They're taking her into surgery.

468
00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:54.254
What else did they say?
Is she gonna be okay?

469
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:57.129
They're gonna do everything they can.

470
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.933
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?

471
00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:08.600
I left her a message telling her I was here.

472
00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.578
You need to call her.

473
00:34:11.415 --> 00:34:12.439
What is it?

474
00:34:14.084 --> 00:34:15.949
It's your dad.

475
00:35:19.049 --> 00:35:20.448
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

476
00:35:20.617 --> 00:35:24.280
- You just missed Elena.
- I was looking for you, actually.

477
00:35:24.988 --> 00:35:26.114
Oh.

478
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.954
Elena is my best friend.

479
00:35:30.093 --> 00:35:33.961
And because she loves you,
I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.

480
00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:36.224
I'm grateful, Bonnie.
I hope you know that.

481
00:35:36.399 --> 00:35:40.893
I do. But I hope you know
that things have to change.

482
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:42.834
Damon has to change.

483
00:35:44.708 --> 00:35:46.335
We both want the same thing.

484
00:35:47.644 --> 00:35:50.238
We both wanna protect the people
we care about.

485
00:35:50.413 --> 00:35:53.780
The difference is, for you,
Damon is one of them.

486
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.748
You saw what I was able to do tonight.

487
00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.547
I know who I am now.

488
00:35:59.289 --> 00:36:04.886
And if Damon spills so much
as one drop of innocent blood...

489
00:36:05.061 --> 00:36:07.188
...l'll take him down.

490
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.436
Even if I have to take you with him.

491
00:36:17.073 --> 00:36:19.371
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

492
00:36:20.977 --> 00:36:22.103
Let's hope it doesn't.

493
00:36:36.826 --> 00:36:37.952
What are you doing here?

494
00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:45.032
A failed and feeble attempt
at doing the right thing.

495
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.594
Which was?

496
00:36:50.006 --> 00:36:53.271
It's not important.
Let me take this for you.

497
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.845
Thank you.

498
00:37:02.485 --> 00:37:05.318
You know, I came in this town
wanting to destroy it.

499
00:37:05.488 --> 00:37:06.978
Tonight...

500
00:37:07.824 --> 00:37:10.384
...I found myself wanting to protect it.

501
00:37:13.129 --> 00:37:15.029
How does that happen?

502
00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:18.264
I'm not a hero, Elena.

503
00:37:18.435 --> 00:37:19.697
I don't do good.

504
00:37:19.869 --> 00:37:21.166
It's not in me.

505
00:37:22.706 --> 00:37:24.105
Maybe it is.

506
00:37:24.908 --> 00:37:30.346
No. No, that's reserved
for my brother and you and Bonnie.

507
00:37:31.314 --> 00:37:36.684
Even though she has every reason
to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.

508
00:37:36.953 --> 00:37:39.012
Why do you sound so surprised?

509
00:37:39.189 --> 00:37:40.315
She did it for you.

510
00:37:41.858 --> 00:37:43.689
Which means
somewhere along the way...

511
00:37:45.362 --> 00:37:48.160
...you decided that I was worth saving.

512
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:51.698
And I wanted to thank you...

513
00:37:51.868 --> 00:37:53.392
...for that.

514
00:37:56.339 --> 00:37:57.499
You're welcome.

515
00:38:44.187 --> 00:38:45.677
Hi.

516
00:38:46.122 --> 00:38:47.214
It's late.

517
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.982
You should probably come inside.

518
00:39:03.673 --> 00:39:04.697
What are you doing?

519
00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:09.178
I don't wanna talk about it.

520
00:39:50.353 --> 00:39:51.377
You scared me.

521
00:39:51.654 --> 00:39:53.246
I'm sorry.

522
00:39:58.928 --> 00:40:01.920
You know, I first met Isobel
when I was a teenager.

523
00:40:02.532 --> 00:40:06.969
I fell in love with her instantly, although
I'm pretty sure she never loved me.

524
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:09.168
She was special.

525
00:40:09.572 --> 00:40:12.905
Part of why I hate the vampires so much
is because of what she became.

526
00:40:14.177 --> 00:40:16.077
How it ruined her.

527
00:40:17.714 --> 00:40:21.150
And I never would've sent her to Damon
had I known she wanted to turn.

528
00:40:24.988 --> 00:40:26.717
It's my fault.

529
00:40:28.491 --> 00:40:31.756
I'm telling you this because I hope...

530
00:40:31.928 --> 00:40:34.260
...maybe you'd understand.

531
00:40:38.234 --> 00:40:39.326
Thank you.

532
00:40:40.603 --> 00:40:42.195
Can I help?

533
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:46.731
Sure.

534
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.579
Katherine?

535
00:40:56.186 --> 00:40:58.347
Hello, John. Goodbye, John.

536
00:41:01.591 --> 00:41:02.717
I looked everywhere.

537
00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:06.956
Yeah. Someone definitely took my stuff.

538
00:41:07.897 --> 00:41:10.297
I gotta check on Jeremy
before I go to the hospital.

539
00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:12.230
Can you meet me there?

540
00:41:12.602 --> 00:41:13.796
Okay.

541
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:15.801
I love you, Stefan.

542
00:41:21.344 --> 00:41:24.074
Jeremy? Are you up?
